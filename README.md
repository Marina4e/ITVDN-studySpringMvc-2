This ITVDN-course "Spring MVC" taught me:
1.Understand the principles of the Spring MVC architecture and be able to create web applications with it. 
2.Create, read, update, and delete data in web applications using Spring MVC. 
3.Use different ways to connect to databases and use Spring Data JPA to access data.
4.Create, read, update, and delete data in your web application using CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) approaches using Spring MVC.
5.Understand the principles of Inversion of Control and how the Spring Framework implements this approach in Java applications.
6.Use Dependency Injection mechanisms to inject dependencies into objects.
7.Write tests to verify the functionality of web applications (unit tests, integration tests, functional tests).
8.Understand how to validate and handle input data and exceptions in web applications.
9.Create RESTful APIs and process requests to the application.
10.Understand the authentication and authorization mechanisms in Spring Security to protect the application and data.
11.Use asynchronous requests to improve the performance of web applications.
...And also work through Postman and Swagger with the project.
